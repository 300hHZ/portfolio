Attempt to redesign portfolio page.
Gonna start from scratch. Hiding/commenting out everything for now. 
(I probably don't even need any of the old stuff, honestly, since I'm redesigning everything.)

Starting with Sticky Navigation Bar.
(Inspiration from https://www.instagram.com/p/CKVcqkQgJNK/)

adding dir="rtl" to the nav tag did not align everything to the right.

wanted to make my background have a dark teal accent:
looked up how to make gradients:
https://cssgradient.io/

then i decided i wanted to make it animated:

https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-gradients/

(i'll keep playing around w/ the keyframes block)

Able to get a basic display working with bootstrap's nav class (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/), BUT because I have 6 items, the nav bar wraps around when the viewport width is shrunk, so that it creates two rows, which i don't want.

Tried to fix by having the font size responsive to the viewport width (https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/), but that either made the font size way too small, or even applying a max function to font-size (https://css-tricks.com/how-do-you-do-max-font-size-in-css/) it would still wrap around, even when trying to put white-space:nowrap into both nav and nav-item classes

now experimenting with bootstrap's navbar class (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/)

(ml-auto) is used to justify/align stuff to the right with flexbox (mr-auto is used to left justify/align) (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/#auto-margins)

<span class="sr-only"></span> hides whatever is inside the span unless it's read by a screen reader (ACCESSIBILITY! WOOOO) (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/screenreaders/)

expand-sm to give nav bar more room to breathe before collapsing

collapseable giving me a little trouble.

at first, the menu icon wasn't showing up at all. realized it was cause i didn't have the "navbar-dark" class set to the nav tag, because i didn't want it to override my animated gradient which i realize is dumb, because my gradient would override it, not the other way around. Plus, setting "navbar-dark" class automatically set the font color to white, so i shoulda just done that to begin with.

Then the collapsing function was working fine, but when I pressed the now visible menu icon, the menu wasn't being expanded to show the hidden content. After a lot of searching, realized that bootstrap has it's own script that i needed to link. 

Now I'm trying to implement having a static contact clickable while keeping the rest of the navbar content as collapseable. But I'm having a hard time formatting it. Specifically, Either the button moves down with the expanded menu, or the Contact text gets pushed directly to where the nav-bar brand is. 

Think i'm gonna take a break here for now. This is pretty much what I wanted to accomplish, as long as I can figure  6:50pm

Managed to get a contact box with info on it all nice and snazzed out.
Things to do with it:
make icon and usernames clickable with hyperlinks to email address or social media page or discord invite.
Stylize ContactBox (maybe with neon like border? like Mike Pengel's Pizza Site?) I kind of like how it looks right now too.)
Stylize the font for the usernames. (maybe with same neon lighting as contactbox border)
Add an animation? like an electrical pulse running through the border, turning on the neon lights.)
Add Click Listener and slide animation for when user clicks on Contact button.

Make a credits page?(Make it accessible via a small message hyperlink down at very bottom of page) Thanking everyone who gave me ideas for each feature of the portfolio, and any resource i use (like jabari's photo).
Fix navbar gradient to make it more noticeable.

Thank you Mike Pingel for your pizza parlor code for your neon letter styling.

and for your font style code.

thank you for all of it lel.

trying to figure out what for the neon shadow looks best. settled on this ghosty black on black border shadow thing that looks pretty tight. it looked pretty corny with the border contrasting as silver or yellow or something, but the black border gives it that little bit of texture.
