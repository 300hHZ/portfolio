  Bio: Woo Jin Kim is passionate for the community. Within the choreography dance scene in Irvine, he helped organize dance events with 1,000+ attendees and co-founded a community project, encouraging collaboration and networking among the dance community. He loves expanding his network, joining numerous organizations during college with a diversity of focuses including music, dance, spoken word, LED performance art, and appreciation of cultural not his own, such as Japanese, Filipino, and other various ethnic groups.

  As an electrical engineering consultant, Woo Jin designed power and lighting schematics for a number of facilities, including but not limited to: local strip mall shops, multi-story medical plazas, and car dealerships and 500,000+ sq.ft. distribution centers. His project list also extends outside California in Hawaii, Nevada, Washington, and Arizona, each with their own unique set of codes to observe. Due to the ongoing nature of projects, Woo Jin would wind up drawing, coordinating, or reviewing up to 14 projects at one time. 

  Now as a software engineer, Woo Jin is eager for the opportunity to hone his skills and knowledge and grow within the technological age. He looks to understand the industryâ€™s perspective of technology and how their design philosophies contribute to a community.
